WAGO automation products are used in many Applications in a wide variety of industries and
Areas of their use. When using devices with a fieldbus connection, it was always required
to observe the rules on which the respective fieldbus is based in order to ensure optimal operation of the
Products. This applies particularly when operating products with an Ethernet connection
also to take measures for a trouble-free operation.  

The WAGO products that can be connected to an Ethernet-based communication network are on
easy to set up, efficient operation in closed, industrial networks. There
it does not matter whether the products are couplers without or controllers with control functionality,
IPCs with I / O level or visualization devices are involved: If one or more of these devices is not only
is to be used within closed, industrial networks, it applies on the part of the installer and the
Operator to take further measures for optimal use of the products.

Are the industrial networks publicly accessible (e.g. through freely accessible network interfaces
within the self-contained, industrial network) or publicly accessible (e.g. through
bidirectional data connections via public data traffic (Internet))?
Organizational and technical measures are taken to protect the internal network and the
Ensure data integrity. The measures to be taken depend on what is to be expected
Data and access security risk from a potential external influence.

WAGO recommends taking at least the following measures into account in order to avoid the security risks
minimize and ensure proper use:

1. Control networks and the control components they contain should be public
Networks as little as possible. Accordingly, it is recommended to everyone
Components of the control network through a firewall against disruptive external influence
and not to connect them directly to the internet.
2. Ports that are not required should be switched off in the automation devices.
3. The consideration of "defense-in-depth" mechanisms and the corresponding consideration in
the plant planning is to access and control individual components and
It is advisable to restrict network subareas to the bare minimum.
4. The physical and data technology access to the automation products, the networks
and systems should be restricted to the minimum number of authorized persons.
5. It is strongly recommended to use the standard / default passwords for the first commissioning
to change. In addition, the passwords used should be changed regularly to accommodate the
To minimize the risk of becoming known, and to maximize the strength of them through the
Length and the choice of characters used (e.g. length of at least ten
characters with a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers and special characters).
6. If remote access to the automation components and / or networks is necessary,
Secure access channels (e.g. VPN - Virtual Private Network) should be used.
7. Regular threat assessments should be carried out to see if they have been hit
Measures correspond to the current need for protection.
8. To protect against new or recurring risks - such as viruses, Trojans, phishing attacks,
Attacks on networks and other malware - becomes installation and permanent
We recommend updating the security software on the computers for programming the control software.

In addition to the recommendations, WAGO supports you with consistent product maintenance. In particular
the products from the automation segment are continuously expanded and -
improvements that enable use in our customers' applications - and thus also in your installation -
make it even more attractive and secure. Reported, potential security gaps are examined and evaluated
and shut down, provided that a shutdown does not impair the general functionality of the product.

We hope that these notes have given you the tips that are important for you in order to optimize the
Ensure the use of WAGO products within your automation solution.
